# Python PLC Automation FBD- Programming with ESP32 Micropython



Pyblockplc is FBD programming for PLC, as PLC is here to be more precise an ESP32 uses Lolin D32 Pro.
Basis Micropython and as a PLC operating system a Python program called The ESP32 runs as
plc_os_v1_0.mpy, the program plc_os_v1_0.mpy is the main program in Miropython is called in main.py in ESP32.
Pyblockplc IDE compiles a file called program.json, the file program.json must be loaded into the root directory of the ESP32 and restarted by restart or start the board.
